## Problem
Many cryptography protocols utilize functions, which are easy to compute in one direction, but are hard to compute in the other direction. Such functions are called *One-way functions*. Despite the wide use of one-way functions in cryptography it is an open problem, if they really exist or if the algorithm to compute the the *hard* direction, is just not found yet. 
## Idea
We would like to use ...
## ECC
An *elliptic curve* in this context is a plane curve of the form *``y^2 = x^3 + ax + b``* over a finite field generated by a prime number *p*. A point *P* on this curve is a tuple of *x* and *y*, which satisfy the equation. By defining an operation on all points of the curve we obtain a group. For the identity element we include the point at infinity. The number of all points, which satisfy the eqution is called the order of the group and is finite.
The operation we define is the addition of two points *P* and *Q*, which yields a third point of the curve.

Here we see all points of the curve with parameters ``a=2``, ``b=3`` and ``p=97``.

### Multiplication
We are interested in multipliying points aith an integer on the curve, where multiplication is defined as usual from addition. Multiplication of a point on the curve with an integer *k* yields another point on the curve. So let *P* be a point on a curve with parameters *a,b,p* and *k* some integer, then *``Q = P  k``* is easy to compute.  
#### Path 
We can visualise adding a point to itself by a path. For example if we start with the point ``P1=(17,10)`` on the curve before, we obtain ``P2 = 2 P = (32,7)`` and ``P3 = 3 P = (1,54)`` and so on until we end up with ``P1`` again.

### Dimension reduction
We want to see the relation between ``k`` and two points ``P``and ``Q``. Since the points are two-dimensional, we end up with 5 dimensions. Since we can not visualise 5 dimensions, we map each point of the curve to a number, or with other words, we enumerate all the points.
