## Problem
Many cryptography protocols utilize functions, which are easy to compute in one direction, but are hard to compute in the other dircetion. Such functions are called *One-way functions*.
## Idea
We would like to use ...
## ECC
An *elliptic curve* in this context is a plane curve of the form *y^2 = x^3 + ax + b* over a finite field generated by a prime number *p*. 
### Multiplication
Multiplication of a point on the curve with an integer *k* yields another point on the curve. So let x be a point on a cruve with parameters *a,b,p* and *k* some integer, then *y = x*k* is easy to compute.
